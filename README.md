# The Facebook Wordy Extractor!

# How to use:

Download your Facebook data by going to Facebook.com > Settings and Privacy > Settings > Your Facebook Information > Access Your Information > Download your information. <b>Make sure you download it as json!</b>

Next, extract the folder wherever you'd like, and place the get_words_from_fb.py file from this repostitory and place it in the top-level folder of the extracted Facebook folders. e.g. C:\Users\[user]\extracted_files\get_words_from_fb.py

Run the .py file.  When it's finished, a csv will appear in the same folder containing all of the words you have said in messages and comments.

You will need Python 3.7x or higher, with Pandas.
